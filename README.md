# 🍟 MCD Pickup

Welcome to MCD Pickup, the ultimate replica of that glorious McDonald's display above the counter—the one that has you anxiously waiting for your order to go from "Preparing..." to "Please Collect!"

This is not your average fast-food clone. This is **art**... well, except for the missing animation. But hey, nobody's perfect, right?

# ✨ Features That Deserve a McFlurry
- Hyper-Realistic Order Display: Almost feels like you’re in a real McDonald's. (Minus the fries smell.)
- Secret Menu Access: Click the arrow at the bottom left to reveal the super-secret admin panel. Use it to change orders, impress your friends and stuff like that.
- Deploy Anywhere: Put this beauty on school computers, car dashboards, smart TVs, etc. 
- An Iconic Picture: Okay, okay... I couldn't nail the animations. But we’ve got a stunningly accurate static display. It’s the Mona Lisa of McDonald’s order boards.

# 🛠️ How It Works
1. Open the website.
2. Watch the numbers update magically. (You can control them, but keep the secret safe.)
3. Tap the mysterious arrow in the bottom-left corner for admin-level power. Add, remove, or shuffle orders to your heart’s content.

# 🎯 Why This Exists
Some people build rockets, some cure diseases.
I decided to copy a McDonald's display. And let me tell you, it’s the tech masterpiece no one asked for but everyone needs.

# 🤔 Known "Features"
- 🚫 No Animations? Yeah... let's call it minimalist design.
- 😏 Possibly Too Legit: This could easily be mistaken for the real screen.

# 🤓 Installation Guide
1. Clone this masterpiece:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rocristoi/mcd-pickup.git
    ```
2. Build It (or use the /docs folder)
    ```bash
    npm i
    npm run build
    ```
3. Deploy it anywhere your heart desires.

# 😎 What’s Next?
If I ever get the time—and patience—I’ll add the iconic animation McDonald’s uses.
But until then, enjoy this cheeky, 99% accurate fast-food replica.
